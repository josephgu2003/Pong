// In a faraway land, there lives a bird.
// Every twelves months, that bird spreads it's wings and flies North
// Seeking company, adventure, and color.
// But every year without fail, that bird returns South in the winter
// For it cannot survive in that land of snow.
// Why don't you stay here forever?
// This is a world of black and white
// Win, lose, good, evil.
// Why chase after dreams? Why enter that world of color?

// "Because I must try. At the very least."
// "I don't know."

// a: But you failed, and now you are vulnerable. I won't let you leave here again.
// b: Poor bird, lost its will to fly. I won't let you leave here again.
