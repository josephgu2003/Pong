// Yirou, I probably shouldn't have asked you about your art philosophy before I explained my music first. I'm reading off a script now, because I'm terrible with words and speaking. Which is why recording this is probably good practice.
//Why I play music? Well, I'm a creative person, and I like making something beautiful. But more than that, sometimes people have things on their mind that they either can't express through words, or they simply don't have the courage to say. For me, music became my second and better voice. Sometimes people break down a bit and they can't play music anymore. That was me the whole year until now. Thanks for appreciating my music. I think I'm gonna go shopping for new strings on Amazon with that hundred dollars from last night now.
